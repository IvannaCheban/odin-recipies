         <h3>Give this garlic shrimp recipe a try if you like shrimp and love garlic.</h3>
         <!--Interesting decription maybe with funny story-->
         <p>Shrimp cooks quickly, whether you sauté it in a pan, grill it on a skewer, or pop it into a soup. It doesn't take long for it to turn from grey to pink and become tender to bite into. And this expedience holds true whether you start with fresh or frozen; shrimp that's been frozen is easily defrosted in its packaging in the fridge, or by running cold water over it in a colander until it's thawed enough to work with. You can decide you want shrimp for dinner, pull it out of the freezer, and make it the same evening.</p>

             <h4>Making process</h4>
         <ol>
             <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke.</li>
             <li>Place shrimp in an even layer on the bottom of the pan and cook for 1 minute without stirring.</li>
             <li>Season shrimp with salt.</li>
             <li>Cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 1 minute.</li>
             <li>Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
             <li>Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 piece of butter, and 1/2 of the parsley; cook until butter has melted, about 1 minute.</li>
             <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in remaining 3 pieces butter. Cook and stir until butter has melted, sauce is thick, and shrimp are pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
             <li>Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl; continue to cook butter sauce, adding water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if too thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste; serve shrimp topped with the pan sauce and remaining parsley.</li>
